I learned this recipe from my friend Zach's mom, who probably learned it from Otto Lenghi.
All the ingredients and amounts are really flexible, I make it different every time.

## Ingredients

* Ripe tomatoes, usually 5-8 medium ones
* A red bell pepper
* 1tsp tomato paste, I use double concentrated from a tube, but canned is OK
* 1tsp-3tsp harissa paste, depending on how much spice you want
* 3-4 garlic cloves
* 3-4 eggs
* Feta
* 1tsp cumin
* 1tbsp olive oil
* Salt
* Chopped parsley

## Steps

* Finely chop the bell pepper and garlic and combine in a bowl with cumin, harissa, tomato paste, pepper, and 1/2tsp salt
* Add to a cast iron skillet after adding olive oil over medium heat
* Let cook for 5-8 minutes stirring occasionally, while chopping the tomatoes
* Add in tomatoes and combine, bring to a simmer
* Cook for 15 minutes or so stirring until its thick, tasting and salting constantly
* Make dips in the sauce and crack eggs, simmer for another 10 minutes.
* Remove from heat, garnish with parsley and feta and serve.
