# Lamb Meatballs

Credit for this recipe goes to Otto Lenghi, but I can't find the source online, I think it was on his blog.
I make a ton ahead of time, freeze them and pull them out as needed.
These are the perfect pair with a shakshuka, I usually place them in the sauce preheated 1-2 minutes
before serving.

* 1lb ground lamb
* 2 garlic cloves
* 2tbsp thyme leaves (fresh)
* 100g feta 
* 50g breadcrumbs
* 1/2tsp cinnamon
* 1tbsp olive oil
* Lots of parsley

## Steps

cinnamon, parsley, salt, and a good amount of pepper.
