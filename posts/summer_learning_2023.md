I finished up a three week stay on a rural rice farm in Japan, and
I came home with the goal of doing AI/ML research in college.
The start of undergrad looms in mid-August, so I have around a month and
a half to do some learning.  I have set aside my grand plans
to study ML foundations and will focus on practice: statistics and 
applied deep learning.  

### Statistics

From some browsing and chatting with ML researchers on twitter
it seems a strong foundation in statistics will compound in value as I learn ML.

My primary resource will be the often recommended book 
[All of Statistics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-21736-9)
I will read through at least the first 6 chapters, take notes, and do 
the exercises assigned in the 
[CMU course](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/)

I will experiment with two new study techniques (mostly to figure out what
will work for me in college). First, I will typeset all my solutions in LaTeX.  Second, I have been making 
extensive use of 
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
for learning Japanese, and I will use it to memorize important theorems and
rules.  These are both are experiments so if I don't like how they work for me
I will drop them and go back to studying with my old techniques.

### Applied Deep Learning

The theory of ML/DL is interesting, but I need a foundation in 
practical application to justify the investment of learning it.  I will 
focus on learning enough of deep learning basics (algorithms, 
frameworks, etc.) to train simple models and build apps.

I have chosen to follow the popular online course
[fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai)
My intuition here tells me the choice of course doesn't matter too 
much, the important part is that I start playing with deep learning immediately.

The goal is that I should be able to learn a piece of theory 
(from a paper, textbook, etc.) and implement it in PyTorch with these
practical skills.  I am essentially learning lab technique early in my
career so that research becomes more efficient.

### Proof of Knowledge

The end goal of this learning project is to produce a simple yet interesting
app or tool that will function as proof I am capable of applying ML
techniques to a real project.  Where my interests and skills will lie after
completing this learning seminar are unclear, but I will work with this
goal in mind.  Additionally, I will keep blogging updates and insights.
