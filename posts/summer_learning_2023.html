<h1>2023: statistics and applied deep learning&lt;</h1>
<p><em><strong>June 24th, 2023</strong></em></p>
<p>I finished up a three week stay on a rural rice farm in Japan, and
I came home with the goal of doing AI/ML research in college.
The start of undergrad looms in mid-August, so I have around a month and
a half to do some learning.  I have set aside my grand plans
to study ML foundations and will focus on practice: statistics and
applied deep learning.</p>
<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>From some browsing and chatting with ML researchers on
<a href="https://twitter.com/q6rccn">twitter</a>
it seems a strong foundation in statistics will compound in value as I learn ML.</p>
<p>My primary resource will be the often recommended book &lt;a
<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-21736-9">All of Statistics</a>
I will read through at least the first 6 chapters, take notes, and do
the exercises assigned in the
<a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/">CMU course</a></p>
<p>I will experiment with two new study techniques (mostly to figure out what
will work for me in college). First, I will typeset all my solutions in LaTeX.  Second, I have been making
extensive use of
<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>
for learning Japanese, and I will use it to memorize important theorems and
rules.  These are both are experiments so if I don't like how they work for me
I will drop them and go back to studying with my old techniques.</p>
<h3>Applied Deep Learning</h3>
<p>The theory of ML/DL is interesting, but I need a foundation in
practical application to justify the investment of learning it.  I will
focus on learning enough of deep learning basics (algorithms,
frameworks, etc.) to train simple models and build apps.</p>
<p>I have chosen to follow the popular online course &lt;a
<a href="https://www.fast.ai">fast.ai</a>
My intuition here tells me the choice of course doesn't matter too
much, the important part is that I start playing with deep learning immediately.</p>
<p>The goal is that I should be able to learn a piece of theory
(from a paper, textbook, etc.) and implement it in PyTorch with these
practical skills.  I am essentially learning lab technique early in my
career so that research becomes more efficient.</p>
<h3>Proof of Knowledge</h3>
<p>The end goal of this learning project is to produce a simple yet interesting
app or tool that will function as proof I am capable of applying ML
techniques to a real project.  Where my interests and skills will lie after
completing this learning seminar are unclear, but I will work with this
goal in mind.  Additionally, I will keep blogging updates and insights.</p>
