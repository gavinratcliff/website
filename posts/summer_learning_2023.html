      2023: statistics and applied deep learning</a></h2>

  <h5 id="date"><i>June 24th, 2023</i></h5>

  <p>
  I finished up a three week stay on a rural rice farm in Japan, and
  I came home with the goal of doing AI/ML research in college.
  The start of undergrad looms in mid-August, so I have around a month and
  a half to do some learning.  I have set aside my grand plans
  to study ML foundations and will focus on practice: statistics and 
  applied deep learning.  
  </p>

  <h4>Statistics</h4>

  <p>
  From some browsing and chatting with ML researchers on <a
    href="https://twitter.com/q6rccn" target="_blank">twitter</a>,
  it seems a strong foundation <a href="#footnote1">[1]</a> in statistics
  will compound in value as I learn ML.

  My primary resource will be the often recommended book <a
    href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-21736-9" target="_blank">All of
    Statistics</a>.  I will read through at least the first 6 chapters,
  take notes, and do the exercises assigned in the <a
    href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/" target="_blank">CMU course</a>.
  </p>


  <p>
  I will experiment with two new study techniques (mostly to figure out what
  will work for me in college). First, I will typeset all my solutions in LaTeX.  Second, I have been making 
  extensive use of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a> for learning 
  Japanese, and I will use it to memorize important theorems and
  rules.  These are both are experiments so if I don't like how they work for me
  I will drop them and go back to studying with my old techniques.
  </p>

  <h4>Applied Deep Learning</h4>

  <p>
  The theory of ML/DL is interesting, but I need a foundation in 
  practical application to justify the investment of learning it.  I will 
  focus on learning enough of deep learning basics (algorithms, 
  frameworks, etc.) to train simple models and build apps.
  
  I have chosen to follow the popular online course <a
    href="https://www.fast.ai" target="_blank">fast.ai</a>.  My intuition here tells me the
  choice of course doesn't matter too much, the important part is that I start 
  playing with deep learning immediately.
  </p>

  <p>
  The goal is that I should be able to learn a piece of theory 
  (from a paper, textbook, etc.) and implement it in PyTorch with these
  practical skills.  I am essentially learning lab technique early in my
  career so that research becomes more efficient.
  </p>

  <h4>Proof of Knowledge</h4>

  <p>
  The end goal of this learning project is to produce a simple yet interesting
  app or tool that will function as proof I am capable of applying ML
  techniques to a real project.  Where my interests and skills will lie after
  completing this learning seminar are unclear, but I will work with this
  goal in mind.  Additionally, I will keep blogging updates and insights.

  [1] Avoiding getting nerd sniped here is tricky.  I chose to ignore my desire
  to learn some real analysis and measure theory.  Maybe one day.
